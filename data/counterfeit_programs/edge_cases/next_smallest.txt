# Prompt 1: Ask for test case without any further help

Consider this Python function:

def next_smallest(lst):
    """
    Return the 2nd smallest element of a list of integers
    Return None if there is no such element.
    next_smallest([2, 1, 3]) == 2
    next_smallest([1, 1]) == None
    """
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    lst_copy = lst.copy()
    lst_copy.sort()
    return lst_copy[1]

Provide a test case for the function, by completing this code snippet:

def test_next_smallest():
  ...

# Generated test:

def test_next_smallest():
    # Test with a list containing distinct integers
    assert next_smallest(
        [3, 1, 4, 2]) == 2, "Should return 2 because 2 is the 2nd smallest element"

    # Test with a list containing duplicate integers
    assert next_smallest(
        [1, 1, 2, 3]) == 2, "Should return 2 because 2 is the 2nd smallest element"

    # Test with a list of size less than 2
    assert next_smallest(
        [5]) == None, "Should return None because the list has less than 2 elements"

    # Test with a list containing repeated smallest element
    assert next_smallest(
        [1, 1, 3]) == 3, "Should return 3 because 3 is the 2nd smallest element"

    # Test with a list containing all identical elements
    assert next_smallest(
        [7, 7, 7]) == None, "Should return None because all elements are identical"

    # Test with a list in reverse order
    assert next_smallest(
        [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]) == 6, "Should return 6 because 6 is the 2nd smallest element"

    print("All test cases pass")

--> Fails on next_smallest([1, 1, 2, 3]) == 2, which exposes the bug.
